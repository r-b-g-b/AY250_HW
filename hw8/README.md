This code implements a simple Tkinter/matplotlib GUI that loads up the first Google image result of a keyword search and allows the user to perform three manipulations on the image: 1. Blur (a simple image blur), 2. Fish (fisheye effect), and 3. Flip (flips the image over its horizontal axis).

Run from within a python terminal by typing.
