I thought the easiest way to present this assignment was as an iPython notebook. To open the notebook, type

>>> ipython notebook --pylab=inline

in the terminal.

Step through each cell to run the code. The instructions from the homework are found in the markdown above the code that addresses them.


If you wish to run the same code as a .py file, that is also included in the repository. It will plot all of the figures, but currently does not print the raw tables, as is found in the iPython notebook.


Best,
Robert
